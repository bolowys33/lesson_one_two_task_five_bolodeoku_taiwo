            <p>A football game is a sport competition in which two teams of eleven players each try to score goals by kicking
                a ball into the opposing team's net. The game is played on a rectangular field, with each team trying to advance
                the ball down the field towards their opponent's goal while defending their own goal from the other team's attacks.
                My love for football began as kid in my early school days. I have played the lowest form of it which involves 2-players in 
                classrooms and also the standard form with 22-players on the pitch.
